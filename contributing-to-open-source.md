# Contributing to Open Source projects
## Case
You have fixed a bug in an open source library that you use in a Philips project and want to contribute that fix back to the community.
1. Are you allowed to submit this fix back to the community?
1. Can you use your @philips.com e-mail address or not?

## Answer
Formal policy is that everything is to be checked by IP&S. It will depend on (1) the license of the project and (2) the content of the project. In case the license is in the white list, it is most likely OK. In case of GPL, it depends on whether the project is on the black list and what exactly is being committed.

In case of approval, you may use your Philips e-mail.
How to get approval?

## Send an e-mail to open.source.licensing@philips.com explaining your case:
+ the project to contribute to
+ the license of the project
+ the nature of your contribution (e.g. bugfix or feature)
+ the account and submission mechanism (e-mail, github, etc) you want to use to submit your contribution
